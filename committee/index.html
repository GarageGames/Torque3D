</div></div>

<div class="container">
    <p>
    The Torque 3D Steering Committee is the hand-picked body of community members
    that is responsible for maintaining the core version of the Torque 3D codebase.
    The first Committee was chosen by GarageGames, but new recruitments are made
    by the Committee itself when necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Committee's day-to-day activities include evaluating pull-requests made
    to the engine repository, deciding on a roadmap for the engine's future, and
    of course doing some programming in order to make that happen! The Committee's
    actions are governed by its Charter, which is displayed below.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Committee is <em>not</em> the lead development team for Torque, though
    it tends to consist of people who spend a lot of time using the engine already.
    It consists of volunteers who are passionate about making Torque the best
    open-source game engine out there.

    and energy to fulfilling the committee’s mission. The total committee size
    should remain close to six members.
    </p>

    <p>
    To be considered as a member of the committee, the prospective member should:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Be available for at least 10 hours a week of work on the Torque 3D
        open source product such as programming, documentation, administration, etc.</li>

    If a member is unable to serve on the committee for any reason, the vacancy
    may be filled or left empty at the discretion of the committee. If the
    committee as a whole is unable to perform its duties, it can vote to
    transfer the project to another person or entity with the approval of
    GarageGames LLC.

    <h3 id="charter-reports">5. Reports</h3>
    <p>
    To facilitate the committee’s operation while accounting for members in

    communication available to all members. Each member of the committee has one
    vote. Any member who has not voted seven days after the vote is initiated
    will count as having abstained. Decisions must be approved by a two-thirds
    majority of all members (not only members who participate in the vote).
