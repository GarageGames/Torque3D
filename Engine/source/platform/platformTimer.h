/// specific. This class provides an abstraction around this platform mojo.
///
/// In addition, a well behaved application may want to alter how frequently
/// it processes time advancement depending on its execution state. For instance,
/// a game running in the background can significantly reduce CPU usage
/// by only updating every 100ms, instead of trying to maintain a 1ms update
/// update rate.
