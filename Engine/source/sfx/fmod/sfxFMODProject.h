/// Datablock that loads an FMOD Designer project.
///
/// All events in the project are automatically made available as SFXFMODEvent track
/// datablock instances.  Each event object is automatically named by substituting
/// the slashes in its fully qualified name with underscores and preprending the project
/// name to this; event 'group1/group2/event' in the SFXFMODProject instance called
/// 'project', for example, will be available as a TorqueScript object called
/// 'project_group1_group2_event'.
///
/// This class also works in a client-server environment where the server is
/// not running FMOD.  The event objects are cached in an auto-generated TorqueScript
/// file alongside the .fev project file (x/y.fev -> x/y.fev.cs) which, when available
/// and up-to-date, does not require FMOD for the server-side objects to correctly
/// initialize.
///
/// To establish good loading behavior and for good memory management, it is necessary to
/// wisely distribute events to groups and to manually pre-load groups.  The best solution
/// probably is to have one group of common events that is loaded during game startup and
/// then have one event group for each level in the game that is only loaded for the
/// duration of its particular level.
///
/// SFXFMODProject will propagate it's networking model to all its contents.  This means
/// that if the project is a non-networked datablock, then all event groups, events, and
/// descriptions contained in the project will also be non-networked datablocks.
///
/// It usually makes the most sense to use non-networked ("client-only") datablocks as
/// otherwise the FMOD datablocks will be purged on each mission load.
///
/// @note Only one project's music data can ever be loaded at any one time.
///   Usually you wouldn't want more than a single SFXFMODProject instance in your game
///   data.  Also, only a single media path can be set through the designer API so when
///   loading multiple projects, note that each project will set the media path to its
///   own directory.  For data loading to work, all project thus need to be placed in
///   the same directory.
