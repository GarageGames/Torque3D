/// Root DataBlock class.
///
/// @section SimDataBlock_intro Introduction
///
/// Another powerful aspect of Torque's networking is the datablock. Datablocks
/// are used to provide relatively static information about entities; for instance,
/// what model a weapon should use to display itself, or how heavy a player class is.
///
/// This gives significant gains in network efficiency, because it means that all
/// the datablocks on a server can be transferred over the network at client
/// connect time, instead of being intertwined with the update code for NetObjects.
///
/// This makes the network code much simpler overall, as one-time initialization
/// code is segregated from the standard object update code, as well as providing
/// several powerful features, which we will discuss momentarily.
///
/// @section SimDataBlock_preload preload() and File Downloading
///
/// Because datablocks are sent over the wire, using SimDataBlockEvent, before
/// gameplay starts in earnest, we gain in several areas. First, we don't have to
/// try to keep up with the game state while working with incomplete information.
/// Second, we can provide the user with a nice loading screen, instead of the more
/// traditional "Connecting..." message. Finally, and most usefully, we can request
/// missing files from the server as we become aware of them, since we are under
/// no obligation to render anything for the user.
///
/// The mechanism for this is fairly basic. After a datablock is unpacked, the
/// preload() method is called. If it returns false and sets an error, then the
/// network code checks to see if a file (or files) failed to be located by the
/// ResManager; if so, then it requests those files from the server. If preload
/// returns true, then the datablock is considered loaded. If preload returns
/// false and sets no error, then the connection is aborted.
///
/// Once the file(s) is downloaded, the datablock's preload() method is called again.
/// If it fails with the same error, the connection is aborted. If a new error is
/// returned, then the download-retry process is repeated until the preload works.
///
/// @section SimDataBlock_guide Guide To Datablock Code
///
/// To make a datablock subclass, you need to extend three functions:
///      - preload()
///      - packData()
///      - unpackData()
///
/// packData() and unpackData() simply read or write data to a network stream. If you
/// add any fields, you need to add appropriate calls to read or write. Make sure that
/// the order of reads and writes is the same in both functions. Make sure to call
/// the Parent's version of these methods in every subclass.
///
/// preload() is a bit more complex; it is responsible for taking the raw data read by
/// unpackData() and processing it into a form useful by the datablock's owning object. For
/// instance, the Player class' datablock, PlayerData, gets handles to commonly used
/// nodes in the player model, as well as resolving handles to textures and other
/// resources. <b>Any</b> code which loads files or performs other actions beyond simply
/// reading the data from the packet, such as validation, must reside in preload().
///
/// To write your own preload() methods, see any of the existing methods in the codebase; for instance,
/// PlayerData::preload() is an excellent example of error-reporting, data validation, and so forth.
///
/// @note A useful trick, which is used in several places in the engine, is that of temporarily
///       storing SimObjectIds in the variable which will eventually hold the "real" handle. ShapeImage
///       uses this trick in several pllaces; so do the vehicle classes. See GameBaseData for more on
///       using this trick.
///
/// @see GameBaseData for some more information on the datablocks used throughout
///      most of the engine.
/// @see http://hosted.tribalwar.com/t2faq/datablocks.shtml for an excellent
///      explanation of the basics of datablocks from script. Note that these comments
///      mostly apply to GameBaseData and its children.
