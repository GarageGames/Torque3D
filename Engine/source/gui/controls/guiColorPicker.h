/// GuiColorPickerCtrl
///
/// This control draws a box containing a color specified by mPickColor, 
/// in a way according to one of the PickMode enum's, stored as mDisplayMode.
/// 
/// The color the box represents is stored as mBaseColour (for pPallete, pBlendColorRange), 
/// whilst the color chosen by the box is stored as mPickColor.
///
/// Whenever the control is clicked, it will do one of many things :
///
/// -# If its in pPallete mode, execute the regular "command"
/// -# If its in pBlendColorRange mode, update the selector position. The position will be re-read upon the next render. In addition, a cross will be drawn where the color has been selected from. As with 1, "command" will be executed.
/// -# If its in pHorizColorRange or pVertColorRange mode, it will function in a similar manner to 2, but the selector will resemble a horizontal or vertical bar.
/// -# If its in pHorizAlphaRange or pVertAlphaRange mode, it will also function the same way as 3
/// -# If its in pDropperBackground mode, nothing will happen
///
/// Colours are drawn in different ways according to mDisplayMode:
///
/// -# With pPallete, a box with a blank color, mBaseColor is drawn.
/// -# With pHorizColorRange, a horizontal box with colors blending in the range, mColorRange.
/// -# With pVertColorRange, a vertical box with colors blending in the range, mColorRange.
/// -# With pBlendColorRange, a box, the bottom colors being black, but the top left being white, and the top right being mBaseColor.
/// -# With pHorizAlphaRange, a horizontal box with black blending with an alpha from 0 to 255
/// -# With pVertAlphaRange, a vertical box with black blending with an apha from 0 to 255
/// -# With pDropperBackground, nothing is drawn
