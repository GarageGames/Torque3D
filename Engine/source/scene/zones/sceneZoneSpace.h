/// Abstract base class for an object that manages zones in a scene.
///
/// This class adds the ability to SceneSpace to define and manage zones within the object's
/// space.  Zones are used to determine visibility in a scene.
///
/// Each zone space manages one or more zones in a scene.  All the zones must be within the
/// AABB of the zone space but within that AABB, the zone space is free to distribute and
/// manage zones in arbitrary fashion.
///
/// For scene traversal, zone spaces are interconnected.  By default, zone spaces get a chance
/// to connect to each other when being moved into each other's zones.  An exception to this
/// is the root zone since it is both immobile and without position and (limited) extents.  If
/// a zone space wants to connect to the root zone, it must do so manually (same goes for
/// disconnecting).
