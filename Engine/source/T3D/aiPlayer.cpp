	"@brief A Player object not controlled by conventional input, but by an AI engine.\n\n"

	"The AIPlayer provides a Player object that may be controlled from script.  You control "
   "where the player moves and how fast.  You may also set where the AIPlayer is aiming at "
   "-- either a location or another game object.\n\n"

   "The AIPlayer class does not have a datablock of its own.  It makes use of the PlayerData "
   "datablock to define how it looks, etc.  As the AIPlayer is an extension of the Player class "
   "it can mount objects and fire weapons, or mount vehicles and drive them.\n\n"

   "While the PlayerData datablock is used, there are a number of additional callbacks that are "
   "implemented by AIPlayer on the datablock.  These are listed here:\n\n"

   "void onReachDestination(AIPlayer obj) \n"
   "Called when the player has reached its set destination using the setMoveDestination() method.  "
   "The actual point at which this callback is called is when the AIPlayer is within the mMoveTolerance "
   "of the defined destination.\n\n"

   "void onMoveStuck(AIPlayer obj) \n"
   "While in motion, if an AIPlayer has moved less than moveStuckTolerance within a single tick, this "
   "callback is called.  From here you could choose an alternate destination to get the AIPlayer moving "
   "again.\n\n"

   "void onTargetEnterLOS(AIPlayer obj) \n"
   "When an object is being aimed at (following a call to setAimObject()) and the targeted object enters "
   "the AIPlayer's line of sight, this callback is called.  The LOS test is a ray from the AIPlayer's eye "
   "position to the center of the target's bounding box.  The LOS ray test only checks against interiors, "
   "statis shapes, and terrain.\n\n"

   "void onTargetExitLOS(AIPlayer obj) \n"
   "When an object is being aimed at (following a call to setAimObject()) and the targeted object leaves "
   "the AIPlayer's line of sight, this callback is called.  The LOS test is a ray from the AIPlayer's eye "
   "position to the center of the target's bounding box.  The LOS ray test only checks against interiors, "
   "statis shapes, and terrain.\n\n"
