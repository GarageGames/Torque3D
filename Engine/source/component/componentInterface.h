// CodeReview [patw, 2, 13, 2007] The issue I have not addressed in this class is
// interface locking. I think that we want to do this, for sure, but I also want
// to keep it as light-weight as possible. For the most part, there should only
// ever be one thing doing something with a component at one time, but I can see
// many situations where this wouldn't be the case. When we decide to address
// the issues of locking, I believe it should be done here, at the ComponentInterface
// level. I would like lock functionality to be as centralized as possible, and
// so this is the place for it. The functionality is critical for safe useage of
// the ComponentProperty class, so implementation here would also be ideal.

// CodeReview [patw, 2, 14, 2007] This really should be a ref-counted object
