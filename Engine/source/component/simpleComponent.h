   // This method is called on each component as it's parent is getting onAdd
   // called. The purpose of overloading this method is to expose cached interfaces
   // before onComponentRegister is called, so that other components can depend on the
   // interfaces you expose in order to register properly. This functionality
   // will be demonstrated in a more advanced example.

      // example, if there existed a class-heirarchy of components, it would be
      // critical, so for good practice, call up to the Parent.
      Parent::registerInterfaces( owner );

      // Now we should go ahead and register our cached interface. What we are doing
      // is telling the component which contains this component (if it exists)
      // all of the interfaces that we expose. When this call is made, it will
      // recurse up the owner list.
      //
      // For example, there exists components A, B, and C.
      // A owns B, and B owns C.
      //
      // If C exposes a cached interface, it will expose it via registerCachedInterface
      // when registerInterfaces is recursively called. It will add it's interface to
      // it's cache list, and then pass the register call up to it's parent. The parent
      // will also cache the interface, and continue to pass the cache call up the
      // child->parent chain until there exists no parent.
      //
      // The result is that, if C exposes an interface 'foo', and A owns B, and
      // B owns C, an interface request for 'foo' given to component A will result
      // in 'foo' being returned, even though A does not expose 'foo'. This makes
      // it possible for a component to query it's owner for an interface, and
      // not care where that interface is exposed. It also allows for game code
      // to work with any SimComponent and query that component for any interface
      // it wants without knowing or caring exactly where it is coming from.
      //
      // registerCachedInterface returns a boolean value if it was successful.
      // Success results in the caching of this interface throughout the full
      // child->parent chain. An interface will be added to a cache list
      // successfully iff there exists no entry in that list that has matching
      // values for 'type', 'name' and 'owner'.
