// It may seem like some weak sauce to use a unit test for this, however
// it is very, very easy to set breakpoints in a unit test, and trace
// execution in the debugger, so I will use a unit test.
//
// Note I am not using much actual 'test' functionality, just providing
// an easy place to examine the functionality that was described and implemented
// in the header file.
//
// If you want to run this code, simply run Torque, pull down the console, and
// type:
//    unitTest_runTests("Components/SimpleComponent");

      // When instantiating, and working with a SimObject in C++ code, such as
      // a unit test, you *may not* allocate a SimObject off of the stack.
      //
      // For example:
      //    SimpleComponent sc;
      // is a stack allocation. This memory is allocated off of the program stack
      // when the function is called. SimObject deletion is done via SimObject::deleteObject()
      // and the last command of this method is 'delete this;' That command will
      // cause an assert if it is called on stack-allocated memory. Therefor, when
      // instantiating SimObjects in C++ code, it is imperitive that you keep in
      // mind that if any script calls 'delete()' on that SimObject, or any other
      // C++ code calls 'deleteObject()' on that SimObject, it will crash.
      SimpleComponent *sc = new SimpleComponent();

      // SimObject::registerObject must be called on a SimObject before it is
      // fully 'hooked in' to the engine.
      //
      // Tracing execution of this function will let you see onAdd get called on
      // the component, and you will see it cache the interface we exposed.

      // query. This is the "complete" way to obtain an interface, and it is too
      // heavy-weight for most cases. A simplified query will be performed next,
      // to demonstrate the usage of both.

      AssertFatal( scQueriedInterface != NULL, "No valid SimpleComponentInterface was found in query" );

      // Lets do it again, only we will execute the query on the parent instead,
      // in a simplified way. Remember the parent component doesn't expose any
      // interfaces at all, so the success of this behavior is entirely dependent
      // on the recursive registration that occurs in registerInterfaces()
      SimpleComponentInterface *ownerQueriedInterface = testOwner->getInterface<SimpleComponentInterface>();

      // different components.
