   /// The VirtualMountSystem extend the mount system by allowing you to mount and access multiple filesystems
   /// on a single root.  This allows you to mount multiple volume files on a single root without needing to
   /// change source paths that reference those volumes to use new roots.  For instance, you could mount
   /// "missions1.zip" and "missions2.zip", on the same root "", and you could access files from either one.
   ///
   /// If you need to mount a writeable filesystem on a VMS, you should mount it as the first filesystem on a root.
   /// File writes are handled as follows:
   /// 1) If you try to open a file for write, and it exists on one of the virtual mounts,
   /// that is the mount that will be used for writing.  But if the filesystem is read-only then the writes
   /// will fail (and you will get appropriate error codes from your FileStream or whatever).
   /// 2) If you try to open a file for write that doesn't exist, the VMS falls back to the default MountSystem
   /// behavior, which is to use the first filesystem mounted on the root.  If this filesystem happens to be
   /// writable, then you will be able to write to the file.
   /// 3) Nothing special is done for the WriteAppend case; that is, it follows the same logic as if you were
   /// just trying to Write the file.
   ///
   /// Because of rule 1) above, you should take care that any files you need to write (such as prefs.cs), are not
   /// included in read-only zip archive files.
