/// This interface allows you to let any object be ticked. You use it like so:
/// @code
/// class FooClass : public SimObject, public virtual ITickable
/// {
///    // You still mark SimObject as Parent
///    typdef SimObject Parent;
/// private:
/// ...
///
/// protected:
///    // These three methods are the interface for ITickable
///    virtual void interpolateTick( F32 delta );
///    virtual void processTick();
///    virtual void advanceTime( F32 timeDelta );
///
/// public:
/// ...
/// };
/// @endcode
/// Please note the three methods you must implement to use ITickable, but don't
/// worry. If you forget, the compiler will tell you so. Also note that the
/// typedef for Parent should NOT BE SET to ITickable, the compiler will <i>probably</i>
/// also tell you if you forget that. Last, but assuridly not least is that you note
/// the way that the inheretance is done: public <b>virtual</b> ITickable
/// It is very important that you keep the virtual keyword in there, otherwise
/// proper behavior is not guarenteed. You have been warned.
///
/// The point of a tickable object is that the object gets ticks at a fixed rate
/// which is one tick every 32ms. This means, also, that if an object doesn't get
/// updated for 64ms, that the next update it will get two-ticks. Basically it
/// comes down to this. You are assured to get one tick per 32ms of time passing
/// provided that isProcessingTicks returns true when ITickable calls it.
///
/// isProcessingTicks is a virtual method and you can (should you want to)
/// override it and put some extended functionality to decide if you want to
/// recieve tick-notification or not.
///
/// The other half of this is that you get time-notification from advanceTime.
/// advanceTime lets you know when time passes regardless of the return value
/// of isProcessingTicks. The object WILL get the advanceTime call every single
/// update. The argument passed to advanceTime is the time since the last call
/// to advanceTime. Updates are not based on the 32ms tick time. Updates are
/// dependant on framerate. So you may get 200 advanceTime calls in a second, or you
/// may only get 20. There is no way of assuring consistant calls of advanceTime
/// like there is with processTick. Both are useful for different things, and
/// it is important to understand the differences between them.
///
/// Interpolation is the last part of the ITickable interface. It is called
/// every update, as long as isProcessingTicks evaluates to true on the object.
/// This is used to interpolate between 32ms ticks. The argument passed to
/// interpolateTick is the time since the last call to processTick. You can see
/// in the code for ITickable::advanceTime that before a tick occurs it calls
/// interpolateTick(0) on every object. This is to tell objects which do interpolate
/// between ticks to reset their interpolation because they are about to get a
/// new tick.
///
/// This is an extremely powerful interface when used properly. An example of a class
/// that properly uses this interface is GuiTickCtrl. The documentation for that
/// class describes why it was created and why it was important that it use
/// a consistant update frequency for its effects.
/// @see GuiTickCtrl
///
/// @todo Support processBefore/After and move the GameBase processing over to use ITickable
