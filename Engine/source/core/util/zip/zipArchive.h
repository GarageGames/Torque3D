/// @brief Class for accessing Zip files
///
/// ZipArchive provides two interfaces for reading or writing zip files.
/// The first is a stream based interface that should be familiar to anyone
/// who's ever written code, and the other is an archiver interface that
/// should be familiar to anyone who's ever used a standard Zip application.
///
/// The two interfaces are not mutually exclusive so you can use both if
/// you wish. For example, you may want to use the stream interface to add
/// a configuration file to a zip without having to create a temporary file
/// and then add a number of existing files using the addFile() method.
///
/// Both interfaces have their advantages and disadvantages, which will
/// be discussed below.
///
/// <h3>Accessing a Zip file</h3>
///
/// Before you can access any files in the zip, you first need to open the
/// archive. This is the same regardless of which interface you use, and there
/// are two ways to accomplish it.
///
/// <b>Opening from a file on the file system</b>
///
/// The simplest method of opening a zip file is to use openArchive(const char *, AccessMode)
/// to open a file that is on the disk.
///
/// When opening a zip file on the file system, the filename is automatically set.
///
/// <b>Opening a file from a stream</b>
///
/// A more advanced way to open the zip file is from an arbitrary stream. The
/// only requirements are that the stream supports seeking and was opened with
/// the correct access mode. Use the openArchive(Stream *, AccessMode) method to
/// do this.
///
/// Opening zip files from arbitrary streams is a very powerful feature and
/// opens many interesting doors. For example, combined with some small changes
/// to the resource manager and startup code, it was possible to implement a
/// VFS that allows the entire game to run from a single executable with no
/// external files.
///
/// Note that the filename is not automatically set when you open the zip file
/// from a stream. The filename is used in error reporting and by the resource
/// manager, so you may wish to set it to something meaningful.
///
/// Regardless of which method you use to open the file, the #AccessMode controls
/// what you can do with it. If you open the archive as #ReadWrite, you can both
/// write to and read from files in the zip. However, it is not possible to open
/// files in the zip as #ReadWrite.
///
/// <b>Closing the zip file</b>
///
/// When you are done with the zip file, call closeArchive() to free any resources
/// and rebuild the zip file if it was open for #Write.
///
/// <b>Example</b>
///
/// @code
/// Zip::ZipArchive za;
/// if(za.openArchive("filename.zip", ZipArchive::Read))
/// {
///    // ... do stuff ...
///    za.closeArchive();
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// <h3>Archiver Interface</h3>
///
/// The archiver style interface allows you to add, extract and delete files in
/// the zip in a way similar to that of an standard archiver application.
///
/// While the archiver interface is simple to use, it is blocking and thus
/// difficult to use asynchronously. If you require zip file support and
/// responsive UI then you should consider using the stream interface instead.
///
/// See the following method documentation for more information:
///
/// <ul>
///   <li> addFile()
///   <li> extractFile()
///   <li> deleteFile()
/// </ul>
///
/// <b>Example</b>
///
/// @code
/// Zip::ZipArchive za;
/// if(za.openArchive("filename.zip", ZipArchive::ReadWrite))
/// {
///    // Extract a file
///    za.extractFile("test.txt", "test.txt");
///    // Add a file
///    za.addFile("test.txt", "test.txt");
///    // Delete a file
///    za.deleteFile("test.txt");
///
///    za.closeArchive();
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// <h3>Stream Interface</h3>
///
/// The stream based interface allows you to access files within the zip
/// in a similar way to accessing the file system through the ResourceManager.
///
/// There are a few small caveats to the stream interface:
/// <ul>
///   <li> When writing files, the whole file must be written sequentially. You
///        cannot seek in the stream.
///   <li> It may or may not be possible to seek in streams opened for read.
///        Files that were not compressed in the zip file support seeking with
///        no penalty. In all cases where the file is compressed, if seeking is
///        supported by the decompression and/or decryption filter then it
///        carries with it an extreme performance penalty and should be avoided.
///        All currently available decompression filters (Deflate and BZip2) and
///        decryption filters (Zip 2.0 and AES) support seeking, but have to reset
///        their state and re-decompress/decrypt the entire file up to the point
///        you are seeking to. An extreme example would be that if you had a
///        20MB file and were currently at the end of the file, seeking back 1 byte
///        of the file would cause the entire file to be decompressed again. This
///        would be a blocking operation that would lock Torque up for an appreciable
///        chunk of time.
///   <li> Files can only be open as #Read or #Write, but not #ReadWrite
///   <li> Only one file can be open for read at a time, but multiple files can
///        be open for write at a time. - [tom, 2/9/2007] Check this
/// </ul>
///
/// See the following method documentation for more information:
///
/// <ul>
///   <li> openFile()
///   <li> closeFile()
/// </ul>
///
/// <b>CRC Checking</b>
///
/// Unlike the archiver interface, there is no automatic CRC checking when
/// reading from files using the stream interface. If you will only be
/// reading files sequentially, see the documentation for ZipStatFilter
/// for a useful trick to get easy CRC checking.
///
/// <b>Example</b>
///
/// @code
/// Zip::ZipArchive za;
/// if(za.openArchive("filename.zip", ZipArchive::Write))
/// {
///    // Write to the file
///    Stream *stream;
///    if(stream = za.openFile("test.txt", ZipArchive::Write))
///    {
///       stream->writeLine((U8 *)"Hello, Zipped World!");
///       za.closeFile(stream);
///    }
///
///    za.closeArchive();
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// <h3>Compressed Files</h3>
///
/// The zip code included with stock Torque supports "stored" (uncompressed) files
/// and deflate compressed files. The code is easily extensible to support any
/// compression format that the Zip file format supports.
///
/// In addition to the deflate and stored formats, BZip2 is supported but not
/// included with stock Torque. BZip2 support will be released as a resource in
/// the future.
///
/// <h3>Encrypted Files</h3>
///
/// Preliminary support for Encrypted/Passworded files is included in TGB Pro only.
/// Currently, only Zip 2.0 encryption is supported by the stock code. AES support
/// exists and may be released as a resource in the future.
///
/// To set the password used for zips, you need to modify the #DEFAULT_ZIP_PASSWORD
/// define in core/zip/zipArchive.h. This password will be used for all zips that
/// require a password. The default password is changeme. This may be used by
/// TGB Binary users to test encrypted zips with their game. Shipping with the
/// default password is not recommended for obvious reasons.
///
/// The intended use of encrypted zips is for preventing casual copying of your
/// game's assets. Zip 2.0 encryption has known weaknesses that allow an attacker
/// to decrypt the contents of the zip. AES encryption is significantly more secure,
/// but as the password must be stored in the executable it will not stop a
/// determined attacker.
///
/// A script accessible mechanism for setting the password does not currently exist.
/// To use encrypted mod zips, if the password was in script then the password
/// would be clearly visible to anyone that cared to poke around in your scripts.
///
/// Encrypted zip support will be improved in a future version. For now, a more
/// secure method of storing the password is left as an exercise for the reader.
///
/// <h3>Accessing Zip files from script</h3>
///
/// ZipArchive is a C++ class and thus cannot be used from script. However,
/// a wrapper is provided to allow script access to zips. See the documentation
/// on ZipObject for more information.
///
/// <h3>More Examples</h3>
///
/// More in depth example code than that featured here can be found in the
/// unit tests for the zip code (in the core/zip/unitTests directory)
/// and the script code for the packaging utility.
