/// This is a simple thread safe singleton class based on the

/// This singleton is guaranteed to be constructed before main() is called
/// and destroyed after main() exits.  It will also be created on demand
/// if Singleton<T>::instance() is called before main() begins.
///
/// This thread safety only works within the execution context of main().
/// Access to the singleton from multiple threads outside of main() is
/// is not guaranteed to be thread safe.
///
/// To create a singleton you only need to access it once in your code:
///
///   Singleton<MySingletonClass>::instance()->myFunction();
///
/// You do not need to derive from this class.
///
/// @note Generally stay away from this class (!!) except if your class T
///   has no meaningful constructor.  Otherwise, it is very easy to make
