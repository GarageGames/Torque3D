    #179: Fail when too many nodes are requested

1.5.0
released this on Jan 24 2016

This is the first release of the Recast and Detour libraries since August 2009, containing all fixes and enhancements made since then. As you can imagine, this includes a huge number of commits, so we will forego the list of changes for this release - future releases will contain at least a summary of changes.
