GLEW was developed by <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~ikits/">Milan
Ikits</a> and <a
href="http://wwwvis.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/~magallon/">Marcelo
Magallon</a>.  They also perform occasional maintainance to make sure
that GLEW stays in mint condition.  Aaron Lefohn, Joe Kniss, and Chris
Wyman were the first users and also assisted with the design and
debugging process.  The acronym GLEW originates from Aaron Lefohn.
Pasi K&auml;rkk&auml;inen identified and fixed several problems with
GLX and SDL.  Nate Robins created the <tt>wglinfo</tt> utility, to
which modifications were made by Michael Wimmer.
