qtdesigner alone can be more efficient to only focus on ui design..


mainLoop at 449 : this has to disable client loading a mission and whatever

T3D compressed FS has precedence when existing inside the zip (overrides
init & everything)	

core : done ? (check loading/chathud!) -too many fuck-ups-
gui : 75% ? majority lays in Engine. (that tho is 95-98%)
script : kept as t3d, pathing done, check along the way (will end in data/)

init.cs : lots of shit to be removed after the merge with core.
NB : as the template is supposed to represent a ready game template
MIT headers are kept only in Greed Base (rename of TheFunBase after
full & template delete -that's a todo...-)

as long launcher does not launch game AND game handles connecting to a server
there will be no separatation.
NB : gm tool will have an ability for artists/scriptters to start a "temporary"
server (autoclosing after a few mins)

remove all headers from template files (better readability for coders) copyright has
been moved globally in license.txt at the root of template (all template headers are
now invalid)

todo monday : 
- A check if game can run without scripts/server IF not, what are the needed files.


IMPORTANT : of fucking course fucking dont forget to remove console on non gm client 
(and by deduction, disallow a regular client to load gm client)
disable throw items from inv : can cause confusion. (commands.cs server side)

splash : 
A : no other capitals than on "The" and LOADING (else it looks ugly)
(side sub note : of course Zombie Apocalypse can take capitalisation)
B : exclamation mark need to be moved & replaced by a double dot (:)
C : exclamation mark move at the end 
D : main thefunz logo need to be re-scaled as in the banner (see msplash5)
