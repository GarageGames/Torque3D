mainLoop at 449 : this has to disable client loading a mission and whatever

T3D compressed FS has precedence when existing inside the zip (overrides
init & everything)	

core : done ? (check loading/chathud!) -too many fuck-ups-
gui : 75% ? majority lays in Engine. (that tho is 95-98%)
script : kept as t3d, pathing done, check along the way (will end in data/)

init.cs : lots of shit to be removed after the merge with core.
NB : as the template is supposed to represent a ready game template
MIT headers are kept only in Greed Base (rename of TheFunBase after
full & template delete -that's a todo...-)

splash : 
A : no other capitals than on "The" and LOADING (else it looks ugly)
(side sub note : of course Zombie Apocalypse can take capitalisation)

B : exclamation mark need to be moved & replaced by a double dot (:)
C : exclamation mark move at the end 
D : main thefunz logo need to be re-scaled as in the banner (see msplash5)
