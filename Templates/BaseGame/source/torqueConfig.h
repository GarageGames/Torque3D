//Hi, and welcome to the Torque Config file.
//
//This file is a central reference for the various configuration flags that
//you'll be using when controlling what sort of a Torque build you have. In
//general, the information here is global for your entire codebase, applying
//not only to your game proper, but also to all of your tools.

/// What's the name of your application? Used in a variety of places.
#define TORQUE_APP_NAME            "Full"

#define TORQUE_NET_DEFAULT_MULTICAST_ADDRESS "ff04::7467:656E:6574:776B"

/// What version of the application specific source code is this?
///
/// Version number is major * 1000 + minor * 100 + revision * 10.
#define TORQUE_APP_VERSION         1000

/// Human readable application version string.

/// The improved SimDictionary uses C++11 and is designed for games where
/// there are over 10000 simobjects active normally. To enable the new
/// SimDictionary just uncomment the line below.
//#define USE_NEW_SIMDICTIONARY

/// Define me if you want to disable the virtual mount system.
//#define TORQUE_DISABLE_VIRTUAL_MOUNT_SYSTEM

/// Define me if you want to disable looking for the root of a given path
/// within a zip file.  This means that the zip file name itself must be
/// the root of the path.  Requires the virtual mount system to be active.
//#define TORQUE_DISABLE_FIND_ROOT_WITHIN_ZIP

//Uncomment this define if you want to use the alternative zip support where you can 
//define your directories and files inside the zip just like you would on disk
//instead of the default zip support that treats the zip as an extra directory.
//#define TORQUE_ZIP_DISK_LAYOUT

/// Define me if you don't want Torque to compile dso's
#define TORQUE_NO_DSO_GENERATION

// Define me if this build is a tools build

/// Define me if you want to enable the profiler.
///    See also the TORQUE_SHIPPING block below
//#define TORQUE_ENABLE_PROFILER

/// Define me to enable debug mode; enables a great number of additional
/// sanity checks, as well as making AssertFatal and AssertWarn do something.
/// This is usually defined by the build target.
//#define TORQUE_DEBUG

/// Define me if this is a shipping build; if defined I will instruct Torque
/// to batten down some hatches and generally be more "final game" oriented.
/// Notably this disables a liberal resource manager file searching, and
/// console help strings.
//#define TORQUE_SHIPPING

/// Define me to enable a variety of network debugging aids.
///
///  - NetConnection packet logging.
///  - DebugChecksum guards to detect mismatched pack/unpacks.
///  - Detection of invalid destination ghosts.
///
//#define TORQUE_DEBUG_NET

/// Define me to enable detailed console logging of net moves.
//#define TORQUE_DEBUG_NET_MOVES

/// Enable this define to change the default Net::MaxPacketDataSize
/// Do this at your own risk since it has the potential to cause packets
/// to be split up by old routers and Torque does not have a mechanism to
/// stitch split packets back together. Using this define can be very useful
/// in controlled network hardware environments (like a LAN) or for singleplayer
/// games (like BArricade and its large paths)
//#define MAXPACKETSIZE 1500

/// Modify me to enable metric gathering code in the renderers.
///
/// 0 does nothing; higher numbers enable higher levels of metric gathering.
//#define TORQUE_GATHER_METRICS 0

/// Define me if you want to enable debug guards in the memory manager.
///
/// Debug guards are known values placed before and after every block of
/// allocated memory. They are checked periodically by Memory::validate(),
/// and if they are modified (indicating an access to memory the app doesn't
/// "own"), an error is flagged (ie, you'll see a crash in the memory
/// manager's validate code). Using this and a debugger, you can track down
/// memory corruption issues quickly.
//#define TORQUE_DEBUG_GUARD

/// Define me if you want to enable instanced-static behavior
//#define TORQUE_ENABLE_THREAD_STATICS

/// Define me if you want to gather static-usage metrics
//#define TORQUE_ENABLE_THREAD_STATIC_METRICS

/// Define me if you want to enable debug guards on the FrameAllocator.
/// 
/// This is similar to the above memory manager guards, but applies only to the
/// fast FrameAllocator temporary pool memory allocations. The guards are only
/// checked when the FrameAllocator frees memory (when it's water mark changes).
/// This is most useful for detecting buffer overruns when using FrameTemp<> .
/// A buffer overrun in the FrameAllocator is unlikely to cause a crash, but may
/// still result in unexpected behavior, if other FrameTemp's are stomped.
//#define FRAMEALLOCATOR_DEBUG_GUARD

/// This #define is used by the FrameAllocator to align starting addresses to
/// be byte aligned to this value. This is important on the 360 and possibly
/// on other platforms as well. Use this #define anywhere alignment is needed.
///
/// NOTE: Do not change this value per-platform unless you have a very good
/// reason for doing so. It has the potential to cause inconsistencies in 
/// memory which is allocated and expected to be contiguous.
///
///@ TODO: Make sure that everywhere this should be used, it is being used.
#define TORQUE_BYTE_ALIGNMENT 4

/// This #define should be set if the engine should use a 32-bit format for
/// 24-bit textures. The most notable case is converting RGB->RGBX for various
/// reasons.

// CodeReview: It may be worth determining this at run-time. Right now I just
// want to wrap code which forces the conversion from 24->32 in a common 
// #define so it is easily turned on/off for the problems we are encountering in
// the lighting. [5/11/2007 Pat]
//#define TORQUE_FORCE_24_BIT_TO_32_BIT_TEXTURES

/// This #define is used by the FrameAllocator to set the size of the frame.
///
/// It was previously set to 3MB but I've increased it to 32MB due to the
/// FrameAllocator being used as temporary storage for bitmaps in the D3D9
/// texture manager.
#define TORQUE_FRAME_SIZE     32 << 20

// Finally, we define some dependent #defines. This enables some subsidiary
// functionality to get automatically turned on in certain configurations.
