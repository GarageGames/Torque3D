Welcome to the Action-Tactics gametype template for Torque3D MIT. Here is a brief explanation of what it is.

The Action-Tactics gametype template is loosely based on the gameplay system used in the Playstation game Valkyria Chronicles by Sega.
It is a turn-based system designed for single player. The player controls one team, the CPU/computer the other.

Each turn is split into 2 phases, "active phase" when the player is in control of their team and "passive phase" when the CPU controlled team is active.
During one teams "active phase", passive team members will continuously shoot at any moving target which they can see. 
For the player, this means that their currently selected soldier will be attacked when they have the "move button" toggled on.
A moving soldier loses energy, and when their energy is 0 they can no longer move, but will still be attacked if the "move button" is toggled on.
With the "move button" toggled on, the player can point to any part of the terrain and place a marker by using the "left mouse button". 
The currently selected soldier will move towards the marker and either stop when they reach it or when they run out of energy to move.
A moving soldier can be stopped by pressing the "left mouse button" again.

Each soldier is allowed a single shot during their "active phase". 
This is achieved by toggling the "shoot button" and then pressing the "left mouse button" over the chosen target on the screen. eg: an enemy soldier.
Headshots give double damage and will kill a CPU controlled team member with a single shot. Low shots give half damage. 
Dead soldiers drop ammo and a health pack.

To select another team member the player can cycle through them all by pressing the "team button". 
In the demonstration mission the player starts with 3 soldiers in their team.

Right mouse button toggles camera control on and off. 
This disables the mouse pointer and allows the camera to rotate around the currently selected soldier by moving the mouse.

The mouse scroll wheel zooms the camera in and out.

When the player wishes to end their "active phase" of the turn, they press the "End Turn button".
The CPU team now becomes active, and the players team become passive.
When the CPU team has completed its turn a new turn begins. The players team becomes active and all soldiers have their energy restored.

The objective of the demonstration mission is to attack the large "station" model at the far end of the terrain. 
The game ends when either the enemy there have all been killed or the players team are all dead.

The demonstration mission can be played as a game and uses stock art assets from Torque3D MIT.
